Synthetic Data Generator for Missing Datasets (Intermediate-Advanced)
Problem Solved: Lack of data for training machine learning models (e.g., rare scenarios).
What Youâ€™ll Build: A text-based synthetic data generator using a large language model to create realistic tabular data or narratives.
Steps:
Pick a domain (e.g., fake customer reviews or medical records).
Use a model like LLaMA or GPT-Neo (via Hugging Face) to generate structured text.
Parse the output into a CSV file (e.g., name, age, purchase amount).
Validate the data manually or with basic stats (e.g., mean, variance).
Time: ~7-10 days (3 days for setup/domain choice, 4-7 days for coding/validation).
Tools: Python, Pandas, Transformers, Colab or local machine.
Outcome: A dataset of 100-500 rows you can use for testing other ML projects.
